# **Difference between the embeddings**

**1. Euclidean Distances**  
- All computed distances between Skip-gram and CBOW for polysemous words are **extremely small** (under 0.003).  
- This implies **very similar** embeddings in both models for these words on the tiny corpus.

**2. Nearest Neighbors**  
- Both models yield similar top-3 neighbors.  
- Some neighbors (e.g., *“containing”*, *“exposure”*) appear unrelated at first glance. This often happens in **small corpora** where limited co-occurrences lead to weak or coincidental associations.

**3. Reason for Similarity**  
- **Insufficient Data**: With only 10 sentences, both algorithms converge to nearly the same solutions.  
- **Polysemous Words**: “bank,” “rose,” “lead,” etc. each appear in too few contexts to separate multiple senses (financial vs. river bank, verb “rose” vs. flower “rose,” and so on).

**4. Recommendations**  
- **Use a Larger Corpus**: More data amplifies the differences between Skip-gram and CBOW.  
- **Tune Hyperparameters**: Increasing window size or embedding dimension can surface nuanced differences.  
- **Visualize**: Plot embeddings with t-SNE or UMAP to see if any small clusters form.

---

> **Conclusion**: On this tiny dataset, Skip-gram and CBOW learn nearly identical embeddings. To reveal more meaningful distinctions—especially for polysemous words—train on a **larger** or **domain-specific** corpus.

# **Short Explanation for 1(e)**

## **Results Recap**

**Top 5 words with smallest distance** between Skip-gram and CBOW:
1. *window* → **0.0006**  
2. *event* → **0.0007**  
3. *loan* → **0.0007**  
4. *health* → **0.0007**  
5. *actor* → **0.0007**

**'the'** → distance of **0.0024**

---

## **Analysis**

1. **Minimal Occurrences**  
   - Words like *window*, *event*, *loan*, etc. appear **only once or twice** in the entire corpus.  
   - Both Skip-gram and CBOW see **identical** (or nearly identical) context information for these rarely used words. Hence, their embeddings converge almost perfectly.

2. **Constrained Contexts**  
   - These words pop up in **very specific** sentences, so there's no variation for the models to treat them differently.  
   - As a result, the **Euclidean distance** between Skip-gram and CBOW vectors remains **extremely low** (under 0.001 in most cases).

3. **Why “the” Shows Higher Distance**  
   - Despite being a **function word**, in a **tiny corpus** it still has **multiple** distinct contexts.  
   - This small variety can introduce a **slightly higher** difference between how Skip-gram and CBOW place “the,” though the distance is still **quite small** overall (0.0024).

---

## **Conclusion**

> **Rare, single-context words** (like *window* or *loan*) end up almost **identical** in both models because there's too little training data for any divergence.  
> **Function words** (like *the*) can still show **slightly larger** differences in this toy corpus, simply because they occur in a **broader** range of contexts—even though the overall distance is still minimal compared to what you'd see on a large dataset.

   - Skip-gram (window=5) vs. CBOW (window=5) for 'bank' show nearly identical first 5 dimensions:
     ```
     Skip-gram: [ 0.00749896  0.00877408  0.01978303 -0.00819520 -0.00335471]

   - These small numerical differences suggest **slightly** different embeddings but still very close.

2. **Nearest Neighbors**  
   - For 'bank', **both** models list *containing* and *exposure* as top neighbors, then *book*.  
   - Similar to the smaller window (2) results, we see **largely the same** neighbors.

3. **Why Are They Similar?**  
   - With a **tiny** corpus, even a larger window (5) doesn’t dramatically alter co-occurrences.  
   - Both models see the same limited contexts, leading to **overlapping** neighbors.

## **Results Overview**

The top-3 neighbors for words like **'bank'**, **'rose'**, **'lead'**, **'book'**, and **'file'** are largely the same across both **Skip-gram** and **CBOW**:
- Shared neighbors include *containing*, *exposure*, *approved*, etc.
- Similar similarity scores (0.27 vs. 0.26, etc.) suggest **both models** are converging on **comparable** embeddings.

---

## **Why Are They So Similar?**
1. **Tiny Corpus**  
   - With only 10 sentences, each word has very few contextual clues.
   - Both models end up with nearly identical co-occurrence patterns to learn from.

2. **Mixed Domain and Polysemy**  
   - Words like “bank” or “rose” each appear in **two** or **fewer** contexts, covering different meanings (financial vs. geographical, verb “rose” vs. noun “rose”).  
   - The models don’t have enough data to strongly separate these senses.

---

## **Syntactic vs. Semantic Capture**
- **Skip-gram** often picks up more nuanced relationships, especially for **rare** words, by predicting context from the center.
- **CBOW** aggregates multiple context words, sometimes yielding more stable embeddings for **frequent** words.

**However**, in this tiny dataset:
- Both algorithms see **minimal, overlapping** contexts.
- They therefore produce **nearly identical** semantic neighborhoods.

---

## **Conclusion**
> **In a large corpus**, we might see stronger differences:
> - Skip-gram capturing more **fine-grained** or **rare** word nuances.
> - CBOW providing more **smoothed** or **average** embeddings for frequent words.

Here, the data is too limited to illustrate major distinctions, so **both models** converge to similar top neighbors and similarity scores.

# **Short Analysis for 1(h)**

## **1. Overall Similarities**

- Most entries in both Skip-gram and CBOW matrices fall between **-0.30** and **0.40**, indicating **relatively weak** similarities.  
- Negative values (e.g., *lead* vs. *bank* ~ -0.24) occur when two words share **almost no** overlapping context or have contexts that the model deems inversely related.  
- Positive values (up to ~0.54) suggest those words appeared together or in **similar** contexts often enough for the model to link them.

## **2. Noticeable Observations**

1. **High Similarities**  
   - *chair* and *window* (~0.54): They appear in the same sentence (*He rose from his chair to close the window*), hence the models learned a **strong** link.  
   - *loan* and *window* (~0.40): Possibly because “loan” and “window” both share minimal (but coincidental) context or appear near words like *bank*, *approved* in tight proximity.

2. **Polysemous Words**  
   - **bank**, **lead**, **rose**: 
     - *bank* doesn't strongly tie to *river* or *loan* in the matrix, likely due to the **tiny** corpus where each sense appears only once or twice.  
     - *lead* has some negative values, suggesting it rarely shares context with words like *bank*, *rose*, or *book*. It's used in “Exposure to lead is harmful…” or “The lead actor…”, which are quite different from other contexts.

3. **Skip-gram vs. CBOW Differences**  
   - The numbers are **very close** (e.g., *bank*–*window*: ~0.13 vs. ~0.13).  
   - This is expected because we have a **small** dataset, so both models see limited contexts and converge to **similar** embeddings overall.  
   - In a **larger** corpus, the difference in negative vs. positive sampling (Skip-gram) and context averaging (CBOW) would be more pronounced.

## **3. Key Takeaways**

- **Sparse Data**: With only 10 sentences, many words appear just once. That means these similarities can feel almost “random.”  
- **Minor Differences**: The extremely limited corpus makes Skip-gram and CBOW look almost the same.  
- **Polysemy & Semantics**: We see *some* evidence of multiple meanings (e.g., *lead*), but the corpus size doesn’t let either model truly separate them.

## **Conclusion**

> **On a real-world corpus,** we’d expect:
> - **Skip-gram** to capture more subtle word senses or rare-word nuances.
> - **CBOW** to group together words that appear in similar broad contexts, especially frequent words.

Here, both matrices look **alike**, highlighting how **tiny** or **scattered** data leads to nearly identical embeddings.

# **Short Analysis for 1(i): FastText Subword Embeddings**

## **1. Observation**
We requested FastText embeddings for both **valid** words (like *bank*, *rose*, *lead*, *file*) and **misspelled** or **OOV** variations (like *bnk*, *rse*, *led*, *flie*). The model produced **unique vectors** for each.

- *bank* vs. *bnk*  
  - *bank* is in-vocabulary, so it has a trained embedding reflecting its contexts.  
  - *bnk* does **not** appear in the original text, yet FastText builds its embedding from **character n-grams** (e.g., *b*, *n*, *k*, *bn*, *nk*, etc.).  
- *rose* vs. *rse*  
  - *rose* occurs in sentences about a flower and as the past tense of *rise*.  
  - *rse* shares subwords (like *r*, *s*, *e*) even though it's an **OOV** token.  
- *lead* vs. *led*  
  - *lead* might appear in contexts like *lead actor*, *exposure to lead*, capturing multiple senses.  
  - *led* is a separate word that doesn’t appear in the corpus, but subword embeddings handle it gracefully.  

## **2. Implications of Subword Embeddings**
1. **OOV Robustness**  
   FastText never returns “unknown” for *bnk* or *rse*, since it aggregates subword vectors to estimate an embedding.
2. **Morphological Awareness**  
   Misspelled or variant forms (*flie* vs. *file*) share overlapping n-grams, hence partial similarity.
3. **Limitations in Small Data**  
   On a **tiny** corpus, subword learning has **limited** examples of each n-gram. For large real-world corpora, subword modeling greatly improves coverage for **rare** words and forms.

## **3. Conclusion**
> **FastText** leverages **character n-grams** to generate embeddings even for unseen or misspelled words.  
> This solves the OOV issue and can capture morphological relationships.  
> In a **larger corpus**, it produces more robust and semantically consistent embeddings for variant forms (e.g., plural, misspelled, or newly coined words).

# **Short Analysis for Polysemy Demonstration**

## **Observations**

1. **Word2Vec (Static)**
   - **Single Vector** for 'rose' → `[-0.01732692, 0.00707374, 0.01072254, 0.01156665, 0.01476559]`
   - Word2Vec merges **all uses** of 'rose' into **one** embedding, ignoring the difference between **'rose' (verb)** and **'rose' (flower)**.

2. **BERT (Contextual)**
   - **Verb Sense ('He rose ...')** → `[ -0.0260, -0.3900, 0.3947, -0.2319, 0.2355 ]`
   - **Flower Sense ('The rose ...')** → `[ 0.2072, -0.3515, 0.0445, 0.4116, 0.8754 ]`
   - Each **occurrence** of the word 'rose' receives a **unique** embedding that reflects **local context**. 

## **Why This Matters**

- **Polysemy**: Words can have multiple meanings (e.g., 'rose' as a flower vs. past tense of 'rise').  
- **Static Embeddings** (like Word2Vec) produce **one** vector per word, unable to distinguish context-specific senses.  
- **Contextual Embeddings** (like BERT) generate **different** embeddings for **each usage**, capturing the intended sense or part-of-speech.

## **Conclusion**

> **Contextual models** (BERT) effectively **disambiguate** multiple meanings of the same word by **analyzing** the sentence around it.  
> In contrast, **Word2Vec** merges all senses into a **single** representation, which may be less accurate for tasks requiring **fine-grained** sense distinctions.

<h1>Q3: Metrics to Differentiate Syntactic vs. Semantic Embeddings</h1>
<p>We can evaluate word embeddings on two main categories of tasks:</p>

<h2>Syntactic</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Morphological Word Analogies</strong> (e.g., “run : runs :: walk : walks”)</li>
  <li><strong>POS Tagging</strong> (predicting part-of-speech from embeddings)</li>

# **Analysis of Q4 Results: Word2Vec on Custom Corpus**

## **Observations**

1. **Vocabulary Insights**:
   - The model successfully created a vocabulary of **95 words**, capturing key terms like "king," "queen," "man," "woman," "apple," and "orange."

2. **Cosine Similarities**:
   - **`king` and `queen`**: -0.1342  
     - The negative similarity indicates that the model did not recognize a strong semantic connection between "king" and "queen," likely due to insufficient relational data in the corpus.
   - **`man` and `woman`**: 0.0488  
     - A low positive similarity suggests the model captured a weak connection between "man" and "woman," reflecting limited shared context in the data.
   - **`apple` and `orange`**: 0.0839  
     - The slightly higher similarity reflects recognition of "apple" and "orange" as fruits, though the connection is weak.

## **Analysis**

- **Corpus Size**: The corpus is relatively small (29 sentences), limiting the diversity and frequency of contextual relationships for the target words.
- **Training Parameters**: With 10 epochs and a window size of 5, the model captures some relationships but struggles to distinguish or strengthen semantic links.
- **Contextual Overlap**: The corpus lacks sufficient sentences explicitly linking "king" and "queen," or "man" and "woman," which hinders the model's ability to learn these relationships.

## **Recommendations**

1. **Expand the Corpus**:
   - Add more diverse sentences emphasizing the relationships between target word pairs.
     - For "king" and "queen": Include more monarchy-related contexts like shared responsibilities or royal family dynamics.
     - For "apple" and "orange": Add descriptions emphasizing their shared properties as fruits.

2. **Increase Training Epochs**:
   - Train for 20 or more epochs to allow the model to better learn word relationships.

3. **Adjust the Window Size**:
   - Use a smaller window (e.g., 3) to focus on close contextual relationships.

4. **Visualize Embeddings**:
   - Use **t-SNE** or **PCA** to visualize the learned embeddings, assessing clustering patterns for related words.

## **Conclusion**

> The model demonstrates basic word relationships, but increasing corpus size and refining training parameters are essential for capturing stronger semantic and syntactic links between target words.

   - Limited in scope, designed for controlled experiments.
2. **Text8 Corpus**:
   - Vocabulary size: **253,854 words**.
   - Extremely diverse, capturing a wide range of contexts and relationships.

- **`king` and `queen`**:
  - Text8: Strong semantic link (**0.7121**) due to diverse royalty-related contexts.
  - Custom Corpus: Negative similarity (-0.1342) reflects insufficient relational data.

- **`man` and `woman`**:
  - Text8: Solid connection (**0.7344**), highlighting frequent mentions of gender-related topics.
  - Custom Corpus: Weak connection (**0.0488**) due to limited shared context.

- **`apple` and `orange`**:
  - Text8: Moderate similarity (**0.4128**), recognizing both as fruits.
  - Custom Corpus: Weaker similarity (**0.0839**), indicating limited fruit-related sentences.

## **Why These Results?**
- **Custom Corpus**:
  - Small size and limited diversity result in weak or incorrect relationships.
  - Lacks enough relational data to effectively train the model.
- **Text8 Corpus**:
  - Large size and diverse contexts capture stronger semantic and syntactic relationships.
  - Better training data for general-purpose word embeddings.

## **Conclusion**

> **Text8** demonstrates significantly stronger semantic relationships due to its size and diversity.  
> **Custom Corpus** is useful for controlled experiments but requires expansion for training robust embeddings.

# **Analysis of Q5: Comparing Large and Small Corpus for GloVe Embeddings**

## **Observations**

1. **Large Corpus (Text8)**:
   - The Text8 dataset provided a **large and diverse vocabulary** derived from approximately **17 million words**.
   - Words from the corpus were filtered based on their presence in the GloVe vocabulary, ensuring compatibility with the pre-trained embeddings.
   - Embeddings from the large corpus reflected **broad semantic relationships**, capturing nuances across a wide range of contexts.

2. **Small Corpus (Custom)**:
   - A custom corpus of **20 carefully designed sentences** was created, focusing on specific themes such as:
     - **Royalty**: "king", "queen", "kingdom".
     - **Gender**: "man", "woman".
     - **Fruits**: "apple", "orange".
     - **Nature**: "sun", "moon", "river".
   - Approximately **2000 words** were tokenized and filtered to include only those present in the GloVe vocabulary.
   - Embeddings from the small corpus reflected **focused relationships**, emphasizing semantic connections relevant to the specific themes.

## **Why This Matters**

- **Large Corpus (Text8)**: Captures **general-purpose embeddings** due to its size and diversity, making it suitable for tasks requiring broad vocabulary coverage.
- **Small Corpus (Custom)**: Emphasizes **domain-specific embeddings**, ensuring clarity and precision in focused applications.

## **Visualizations**

1. **t-SNE**:
   - Highlighted **non-linear relationships** between words.
   - Showed clustering of semantically similar words, with **distinct clusters** for specific themes like royalty, gender, and fruits.

2. **PCA**:
   - Provided a **variance-based linear projection** of embeddings.
   - Revealed separations and groupings for words based on their semantic and syntactic relationships.

## **Conclusion**

> The **Text8 corpus** demonstrates the strength of large-scale data for capturing broad semantic relationships, while the **custom corpus** excels in focused, domain-specific tasks.  
> Combining both approaches allows for balanced embedding quality, leveraging the strengths of each.
